Docker commands used:
---------------------
$ Docker pull alpine
|---> This command pulls the image to your local machine, but doesn't run it.

$ Docker images
|---> See the images present on your machine

$ Docker search alpine
|---> Search for images on Docker repository. (recommended to use official images)

$ Docker run --rm -ti alpine sh
|---> This one has a long story, we use this to run Docker images.
|---- --rm: is used to delete the image after you are done (not to keep it running)
|--- -ti: means run the "sh" command and stay in the terminal and let me interact with it
|--- alpine: is the image name
|--- sh: is the terminal of choice for Alpine. Note that Alpine doesn't have Bash

Installing software on Alpine:
------------------------------
$ apk add --update --no-cache git
|---> to add new packages
|---- --update: instead of running 'apk update' beforehand. This updates the repo with the latest versions
|---- --no-cache: do not cache the package on the local machine
|---- git: the package you want to install

Installing software on Ubuntu:

$ apt-get update && apt-get install git
